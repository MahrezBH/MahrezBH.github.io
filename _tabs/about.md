## Hi, I'm Mahrez!

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm a passionate software developer, currently working as a cloud computing engineer. My journey in tech began at a young age, and over the years, I've honed my skills in programming languages like Python, Java, and web development technologies such as Angular, Django, and Flask.

### My Skills

- **Web Development**: Proficient in building scalable applications using **Django** and **Flask**. I specialize in building REST APIs, handling complex data models, and ensuring the efficient performance of web applications.
- **Legacy Systems**: Experienced in working with **legacy systems**, including maintaining, upgrading, and migrating older applications to newer architectures, ensuring a smooth transition while minimizing disruptions.
- **Cloud Computing**: Expertise in working with **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud**.
- **DevOps**: Hands-on experience in automating deployment pipelines using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Ansible**, while ensuring smooth integration between development and production environments.
- **Programming**: Proficient in **Python** and **SHELL**, with experience developing backend systems, automation scripts, and web applications.
- **Database Management**: Strong background in managing relational databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**.

### My Experience

- **Django Development**: I've worked extensively with Django, building full-stack applications, REST APIs, and managing databases. I understand Django’s ORM well and have integrated it with third-party tools and services.
- **Legacy System Modernization**: I’ve helped businesses modernize legacy systems, which often involves refactoring code, improving legacy APIs, and ensuring seamless integration with newer frameworks and technologies.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: I have experience deploying and managing applications on cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**, ensuring cost-efficient, high-performance, and secure cloud solutions.
- **DevOps Practices**: I follow best practices in DevOps to automate deployments and streamline workflows. I’ve worked with **Jenkins** to set up CI/CD pipelines and used **Docker** to containerize applications, ensuring consistency across environments.

I’m always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects. When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing video games, reading about new tech trends, and exploring the outdoors.
