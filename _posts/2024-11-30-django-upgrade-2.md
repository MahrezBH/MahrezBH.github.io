In Part 1, we prepared the battlefield for a Django upgrade—auditing dependencies, setting up a testing environment, and cleaning the slate. Now, it’s time to roll up our sleeves and execute the upgrade itself. This is where preparation meets action, and your ability to adapt will make or break the process.

Whether you’re upgrading from a minor version or leaping from Django 2.x to 4.x, this guide will ensure that you do so methodically, minimizing surprises and downtime.

### Step 1: Incremental Upgrades

Unless you’re moving directly between long-term support (LTS) versions, upgrade incrementally. Each intermediary version brings its own changes, and skipping them could introduce hard-to-diagnose bugs. 

#### The Process:
1. **Install the Target Version**  
   In your virtual environment, install the next version in sequence:  
   ```bash
   pip install "Django>=3.2,<4.0"
   ```

2. **Run Migrations**  
   Update your database schema with:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Test Extensively**  
   Use your automated test suite or manual testing to validate core functionality. Focus on customizations and integrations.

4. **Repeat Until Final Target**  
   Move through each version until you reach the desired Django version.

#### Tip:  
For projects with significant breaking changes, consider adding feature flags to isolate new behaviors introduced by the upgrade.

### Step 2: Code Compatibility Sweep

Even if your project starts after installation, lurking deprecations and removed APIs could break things. Here’s how to handle them:

1. **Fix Deprecated Features**  
   Any warnings from Part 1 should now be errors. Update code to match the new API. For example:  
   - Replace `django.utils.timezone.now()` with `timezone.now()` if advised.
   - Shift from old-style middlewares to the new `MIDDLEWARE` format.

2. **Adjust Settings**  
   Update settings for compatibility with the new version. Common areas include:  
   - Database configurations  
   - Security settings (e.g., `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`)  
   - Application definitions  

3. **Update Third-Party Packages**  
   After upgrading Django, confirm that all dependencies remain functional. This might mean upgrading those packages again or finding alternatives.

### Step 3: Test Like a Maniac

Testing is your safety net, and during an upgrade, it’s stretched to its limits. 

#### What to Test:
- **Unit Tests:** Cover all components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:** Test interaction between Django and external services like databases and APIs.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that existing functionality hasn’t been disrupted.  

#### Tools to Help:
- **Coverage.py**: Ensure every code path is tested.  
- **pytest-django**: Simplify test runs with this robust plugin.  

Run your tests:  
```bash
pytest --cov=your_project
```

### Step 4: Data Integrity Check

Upgrading Django often involves changes to database backends and ORM behavior. Ensure your data remains consistent.

1. **Backup First**  
   Always start with a database backup. This step is non-negotiable.  
   ```bash
   pg_dump your_database > safe_backup.sql
   ```

2. **Validate Migrations**  
   Run Django’s migration optimizer:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations --check
   ```

3. **Run Integrity Checks**  
   Use Django’s built-in `check` command:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py check
   ```

### Step 5: Deployment Strategy

Deploying an upgraded Django application can be risky. Mitigate potential downtime with these strategies:

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**  
   Spin up a parallel environment with the upgraded version. Test extensively before swapping traffic to it.

2. **Feature Toggles**  
   Enable or disable upgraded features incrementally to monitor their impact in real-world use.

3. **Canary Releases**  
   Deploy the upgrade to a small subset of users first. Observe and address any issues before a full rollout.

4. **Monitoring Tools**  
   Use tools like Sentry or Prometheus to monitor logs and performance post-deployment.

### Step 6: Celebrate (Then Monitor)

If your application is running smoothly on the new Django version, congratulations! You’ve just accomplished a significant feat. But don’t relax just yet. Upgrades can introduce subtle issues that only surface under real-world load.

#### Post-Upgrade Tasks:
- **Monitor Logs:** Watch for errors or warnings.
- **Performance Metrics:** Benchmark your application to identify any regressions.
- **User Feedback:** Keep an ear out for user-reported issues.

### Conclusion

Upgrading Django is more than a technical exercise—it’s a testament to your project’s adaptability. With the right preparation (Part 1) and execution (Part 2), you can ensure that your upgrade journey is not only successful but also a valuable learning experience.
