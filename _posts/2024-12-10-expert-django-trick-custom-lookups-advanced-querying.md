Django’s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system is renowned for its simplicity and power. It allows developers to write Pythonic code to interact with databases, abstracting away much of the complexity. But did you know you can extend Django’s querying capabilities with **custom lookups**?

This post explores how custom lookups can supercharge your queries by solving a common problem: filtering users by their email domains.  

---

### The Challenge: Filtering by Email Domain  

Let’s say you’re building a SaaS platform where only users with specific email domains (like `company.com` or `partner.org`) are allowed to register. Your database stores users' email addresses, and you need a quick and reusable way to filter them based on domain.  

Instead of scattering custom SQL logic or complex filters across your codebase, we can encapsulate this logic in a **custom lookup** for clarity and reuse.  

---

### What Are Custom Lookups?  

Custom lookups let you extend Django’s ORM by creating new operations for your query expressions. Think of the ORM’s built-in options like `exact`, `icontains`, or `gte`. With custom lookups, you can build tailored functionality specific to your domain, making your queries cleaner and more intuitive.  

---

### Why Use Custom Lookups?  

- **Readable Queries**: Simplify complex filters into straightforward expressions.  
- **Reusable Logic**: Write your custom lookup once, and use it across your project.  
- **Extensible ORM**: Add query features Django doesn’t provide out of the box, like fuzzy matching or advanced string processing.  

---

### Step 1: Define the Custom Lookup  

Here’s how to create a lookup called `emaildomain_in` that checks if a user’s email ends with any domain from a given list.  

```python
from django.db.models import Lookup, CharField

@CharField.register_lookup
class EmailDomainIn(Lookup):
    lookup_name = 'emaildomain_in'

    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        lhs, lhs_params = self.process_lhs(compiler, connection)
        rhs, rhs_params = self.process_rhs(compiler, connection)
        
        # Transform domain list into SQL-compatible wildcards
        params = [f"%{domain}" for domain in rhs_params]
        conditions = " OR ".join([f"{lhs} LIKE %s" for _ in params])
        return f"({conditions})", params
```

#### What’s Happening Here:  

1. **`lookup_name`**: Sets the lookup’s name as `emaildomain_in`, which you’ll use in queries.  
2. **SQL Translation**: Converts the lookup into an SQL `LIKE` statement that checks multiple domains using `OR`.  

---

### Step 2: Use the Custom Lookup  

Now that we have the `emaildomain_in` lookup, using it is as simple as this:  

```python
from myapp.models import User

# Query users with approved email domains
approved_domains = ['@company.com', '@partner.org']
users = User.objects.filter(email__emaildomain_in=approved_domains)
```

The above code translates to SQL like this:  

```sql
SELECT * FROM myapp_user 
WHERE email LIKE '%@company.com' 
   OR email LIKE '%@partner.org';
```  

No repetitive logic or hacks—just clean, reusable filtering.  

---

### Real-World Applications  

Custom lookups aren’t just for emails. They’re powerful tools for a variety of use cases:  

1. **Access Control**: Filter users or employees based on allowed domains in a multi-tenant app.  
2. **Product Filtering**: Query for items by specific product codes or file extensions.  
3. **Tag Matching**: Find entries tagged with certain keywords stored in string fields.  

---

### Pro Tips for Custom Lookups  

- **Performance Matters**: Wildcard queries like `LIKE` can be slow on large datasets. Consider indexing or optimizing the database if this becomes a bottleneck.  
- **Testing is Key**: Edge cases (e.g., malformed emails or empty domain lists) can trip up your lookup. Write thorough tests.  
- **Combine for Power**: Pair custom lookups with Django’s `Subquery` or `F` expressions for even more robust queries.

### Wrapping Up  
Custom lookups in Django enhance the ORM’s flexibility, enabling developers to encapsulate complex query logic into reusable and maintainable components. The `emaildomain_in` lookup demonstrates how domain-specific challenges, such as filtering users by email domains, can be addressed elegantly without duplicating logic across the codebase.  

For further insights into extending Django's ORM, refer to the [official Django documentation on custom lookups](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/custom-lookups/). This approach not only improves query readability but also extends the ORM’s capabilities to fit unique application requirements, contributing to cleaner and more efficient development workflows.
